# Hey there!

Welcome to LiamCoalStudio.

"What is LiamCoalStudio?", you may be asking. Well, it's a single
developer organization for hosting various kinds of things. Here,
you can probably find some graphics things. Maybe even something
relating to Discord, if you're lucky. Really, there isn't any
singluar thing that is developed here.

"Why is LiamCoalStudio?", you may also be asking. Well, it
started when a certain Liam was looking for a snazzy name to name his
packages under. Eventually, LiamCoalStudio caught on, and still has
yet to fall off...
