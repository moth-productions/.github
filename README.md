# Woah! What's this?!

This is a little repository to host some files that GitHub might use to customize the
organization page. Ever wondered how a README is hosted up there? Check out `/profile/README.md`!

Anyways, if you're just a normal user / developer looking for _actual_ code, this is
(unfortunately!) not the place. Go check out the other repositories!

Or, if READMEs are your thing, then you might just be right at home here!
